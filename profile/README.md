## How We Built the Project

Building the VeDA (Verifiable Digital Assets) Platform involved several critical stages, from team formation to deployment. Here's a detailed account of our process:

### Team Formation and Planning

We began by identifying individuals who shared our project's goals. Our team comprised backend developers, frontend developers, UI/UX designers, and project managers. Once the team was assembled, we applied the Double Diamond design methodology to refine our idea and develop a Minimum Viable Product (MVP). The goals of the MVP were shared with the team during a comprehensive planning session.

### Project Management

To manage our project efficiently, we adopted the SCRUM methodology, conducting daily standups and iterative sprints:

- **GitHub**: Used to host repositories and manage our project via GitHub Projects.

- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Implemented to ensure all changes were tested and bug-free.

- **Communication**: Set up a Discord server for ongoing team communication.

- **Brainstorming and Design**: Utilized Whimsical for brainstorming sessions and creating UML design documents.

### Development Process

#### Initial Setup:

- **Frontend and Backend Scaffolding**: Established the basic structure for both frontend and backend projects.

- **UI/UX Design**: UI/UX designers worked on the frontend design using Figma.

#### Frontend Development:

- **Framework**: Built using Next.js for a robust and scalable frontend.

- **Deployment**: Deployed the frontend on Vercel for continuous integration and delivery.

#### Backend Development:

- **Solidity Contracts**: Developed and scaffolded using Foundry.

-  **Base Chain**: Decided to host our Solidity contracts on the Avalanche network.

- **Chainlink Functions**: Implemented for critical functionalities:

    - **Verification Function**: Utilized Google Cloud Vision AI to verify NFTs, creating a Node.js REST API to process and annotate NFT images using IPFS hashes.

 ### Verification API

#### REST APIs:

- **Verification REST API**: This API compares the creator's digital art for uniqueness using Google Cloud Vision AI, assigning a uniqueness score and an approximate selling price. We exposed a Chainlink Function on top of this API to provide a verification data feed.

- **Copyright REST API**: This API checks if digital art owners' NFTs are being used as Discord profile pictures without consent, utilizing pixel comparison techniques.

### Integration and Testing

Once the UI/UX design was complete, we integrated the frontend with the backend services. Comprehensive end-to-end testing was conducted to ensure all components functioned seamlessly together.
